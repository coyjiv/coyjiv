- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm @coyjiv,

- ðŸŒ± As a dedicated professional with over four years of hands-on experience, I'm skilled in constructing robust web applications. My tech-stack primarily revolves around modern technologies such as React, Next.js, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript.

- ðŸŒŸ I have a solid understanding of React.js, where I've utilized component-based architecture to build scalable and maintainable user interfaces. My experience with Next.js has also been rewarding, enhancing my capabilities in server-side rendering, generating static sites, and leveraging its built-in features to optimize SEO and improve performance.
